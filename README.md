# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This analysis illuminated how Kickstarter campaigns performed in different regions for different causes. It further highlights how theater kickstarters perform and identified potential causes for performance.

# Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to predict how certain characteristics would impact the success of a Kickstarter campaign. The client aimed to launch a campaign for a play, and they wanted to design the goals of this campaign based on past campaign successes. Using this analysis, the client was able to adapt their goals for a realistic outcome. 

# Analysis and Challenges
My analysis indicates that most campaigns to fund plays are successful if the goal is under $20,000. The failure rate of campaigns seeking over $20,000 is much higher. This is an important assessment to provide to my client so that she can strategize effectively in pursuing funding. I have encouraged her to seek private funding if the play requires more than $20,000 to produce. 

My analysis also indicated some interesting facts about cancellation rates for play Kickstarter campaigns. Campaigns launched in January were the most likely to be cancelled. My data spans several years and is robust, so this may influence my client's launch date strategy. 

Because the available dataset was so large, it was important to apply relevant filters to extract the information my client needed. Working with the dataset in the original worksheet was fairly straightfoward. I experienced some challenges in creating the Pivot Table based on the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date, because I needed to break down theater performance by month, and not year. It took some negotiation to visualize the data I needed.

# Results

As indicated in the line chart below (included in workbook), campaign success rates are high when the goal is below $20,000 and again when the goal is between $30,000 and $40,000.

Theater campiagns overall have the highest success rates when launched during the month of May and the lowest success rates when launched in December. While cancellation and failure rates are also important to note, I informed my client that extrapolating data from the most successful campaigns were highlighted so that she could replicate those qualities in her own campaign.

There are limitations with this dataset. Due to its size, we are not able to drill down into greater details about why these campaigns experienced their outcomes. Because my client was specifically concerned with the outcomes of play campaigns, it would have been useful to work with a dataset that was focused on this subcategory.
